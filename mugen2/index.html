            There is no end though there is a start in space. <br>
            --- Infinity.<br>
            It has own power, it ruins, <br>
            and it goes though there is a start also in the star. <br>

            Only the person who was wisdom<br>
            can read the most foolish one from the history. <br>
            The fish that lives in the sea<br>
            doesn't know the world in the land. <br>
            It also ruins and goes if they have wisdom

            It is funnier that man exceeds the speed of light <br>
            than fish start living in the land. <br>
            It can be said that this is<br>
            an final ultimatum from the god to the people who can fight.
